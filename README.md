# Lap-Time-Prediction-Model
## Overview
The Lap Time Prediction Model is a tool built to assist engineers and data scientists in analysing the factors that influence lap times. By leveraging a Random Forest-based regression model, the tool provides insights into the relationship between speed, distance, and other features with lap times.

### Features:
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using historical data.
- **Prediction**: Predict lap times with high accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score.
- **Customisation**: Easily extendable to include additional features or alternate models.
